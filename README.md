# About
This project aims to produce a simple CLI program to fetch and display the headlines of the day.
Headlines can then be selected by the user, at which point the corresponding story will be downloaded and displayed.
Extra features may also include downloading a weather summary, and being able to store user preferences.

# Methodology
It is yet to be decided whether a news source will be scraped for relevent data, or whether a news API will be used.
A potential API could be newsapi.org
